description: 이 책은 영어로 제작되었습니다. 한국어판은 '운석 사냥꾼 진유하 아쿠아 행성편'으로도 출판되어 있으니 참고 바랍니다.<br/><br/>…In the moment I was about to turn away, I suddenly felt a surge of curiosity stronger than fear. Wasn't becoming a meteorite hunter and choosing the path of adventure started by my desire to explore unknown worlds that no one else easily dared to? I remember my initial determination when I changed my course to choose this new profession. Having traveled the world and accumulated experiences over the past few years, I was not so frail as to turn away from such uncertain dangers. Ignoring my instinct to explore and turning my back felt wrong, as I strongly believed something tremendous was inside. Unintentionally, I turned my steps.<br/><br/>In the year 20XX in Korea, Yuha Jin is a ‘meteorite hunter’ who collects and sells meteorites. One day, after hearing a signal that a meteorite had fallen, Yuha and his AI assistant, Frimal, headed to the Uyut Desert. Despite their search, they find nothing—not even a trace of the meteorite. What could have possibly happened there? This is a science fiction novel that incorporates a hypothesis to solve Earth's environmental issues.<br/><br/>Author | EUNJOLEE, Jeongbin Park<br/><br/>Editor | EUNJOLEE, Jeongbin Park<br/><br/>Cover Design | EUNJOLEE<br/><br/>Illustrations | EUNJOLEE<br/><br/>Publisher | EUNJOLEE<br/><br/>Date of Publication | May 3, 2024<br/><br/>Price | 6 USD<br/><br/>#SF #SF소설 #과학 #소설 #환경 #외계인 #모험
