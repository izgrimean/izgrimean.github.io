  <p>○ This book is available in English.</p>
  <p>This book describes fundamental concepts for studying organic chemistry. It covers chemical concepts that are commonly applied across the entire spectrum of organic chemistry, from general chemistry principles like chemical bonding and orbitals to physical properties, nomenclature, and stereochemistry. Drawing on the collective wisdom of the masses, it was possible to complete the category of organic chemistry, and it is believed that this created category is the most efficient way to learn organic chemistry concepts.</p>
  <p>I opened a blog called “Jeongbin’s Study Room” to collect knowledge from many people. The enthusiasm for organic chemistry is still strong today, but a few years ago, it was significant, as organic chemistry was essential for various exams. Since studying organic chemistry in elementary, middle, and high school was rare, I anticipated a significant academic demand for organic chemistry. Therefore, since 2018, I have been sharing articles on organic chemistry on “Jeongbin’s Study Room” and communicating, correcting, and discussing with people. I have had many discussions online with medical professionals, pharmacists, lawyers, current teachers, and professors, among others. Now, as we welcome the new year 2024, I declare that the compilation of organic chemistry knowledge through collective intelligence is complete and I am publishing this book. I hope that this book can lower the barrier of organic chemistry as a field of study.</p>
